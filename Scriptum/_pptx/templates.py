        - a set of text boxes
        - text boxes mixed with auto_shapes (graphic objects, used as "dummy frames" for images)
        - text boxes mixed with images - need to implement to copy that (fixed) image
        - combinations of the above but not groupshapes of groupshapes - at least never tested
        - there are only images (usually one) or videos (usually one), but no mix of both in the same groupshape

    ttype == table - which is either -> tag.ns == table (same for all)
        tables cannot be grouped in a groupshape, which is a PPT limitation
        - a single table with a <table:foo/> tag in the first cell
        - multiple objects, where one is a table as above, the rest are text boxes with a <table:foo:bar/> tag
        - more complex was never tested

    ttype == image | ttype == video -> tag.ns == image|video (same for all)
        - single image/video shape
            or
        - handled in the same way as tables before in case there is no way to group that shape

    type == p|text -> tag.ns = p|text (same for all)
        - single paragraph
            or
        - handled in the same way as tables before in case there is no way to group that shape

    empty shapes-list or no tags in shapes are already excluded before!
