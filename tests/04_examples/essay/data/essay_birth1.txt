Attempts to mechanize writing predate the modern typewriter by centuries. Inventors in eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century Europe experimented with devices that could produce legible text more quickly than handwriting, often inspired by printing presses or music instruments. Most of these machines were prototypes or curiosities, and none achieved wide adoption. The breakthrough came in the 1860s and 1870s with the work of Christopher Latham Sholes and his collaborators in Milwaukee. Their machine, known as the Sholes and Glidden typewriter and later marketed as the Remington No. 1, became the first commercially successful typewriter.
