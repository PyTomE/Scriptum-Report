It introduced key elements that would define the industry: a cylindrical platen to hold the paper, a keyboard with four banks of keys, and an internal system of typebars that struck an inked ribbon against the paper. It was also the first widely marketed machine to use the QWERTY layout, which arranged keys to reduce jams in the typebar mechanism and ultimately became the dominant keyboard layout for typewriters and later computers.
Despite its innovations, the Sholes and Glidden had limitations. It could only type uppercase letters, and it was a "blind writer" the typed text was hidden beneath the carriage, forcing typists to trust that the machine was printing correctly. Even so, as Remington scaled up production and partnered with dedicated sales agencies, typewriters moved from novelty to essential office equipment.
