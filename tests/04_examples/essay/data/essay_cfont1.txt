Another frontier in contemporary type design is the emergence of color fonts. Traditional digital fonts describe letter contours and rely on external color settings; a glyph is drawn as a monochrome outline that software fills with a single color. Color fonts, by contrast, embed color information directly in the font file. Technologies such as OpenType-SVG, COLR/CPAL, and CBDT/CBLC allow glyphs to include vector shapes with gradients, layered color planes, or even bitmap textures.
