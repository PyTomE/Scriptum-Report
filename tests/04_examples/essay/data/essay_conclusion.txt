From the clacking keys of the Remington No. 1 to the smooth animations of variable fonts on a high-resolution display, the story of typewriting is one of continuity and transformation. The earliest typewriters mechanized writing, making text production faster, more legible, and more standardized. Electric typewriters and word processors further increased efficiency and flexibility, while computers and digital typography unlocked a nearly infinite space of typographic variation.
Today, sophisticated letter designs enabled by OpenType features, variable fonts, color glyph technologies, and a global ecosystem of type designers allow text to carry nuanced voice and personality, even as it remains grounded in centuries-old alphabetic traditions. In this sense, we are still typewriting, even if the machine sits in the cloud rather than on the desk. The tools have changed dramatically, but the desire to shape written language through careful control of letterforms remains as strong as ever.
