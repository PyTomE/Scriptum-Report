The tools provided by OpenType, variable fonts, and color fonts have catalyzed a rich diversity of design trends. In branding and editorial design, geometric sans serif typefaces remain popular for their clarity and modern feel. At the same time, there has been a resurgence of high-contrast serifs, script faces, and Art Nouveau–inspired display types that feature delicate ligatures and organic curves.
On the web, variable fonts support responsive typography: designers can adjust weight, width, and optical size to optimize reading across different screens. This allows a single type family to serve both dense body text on mobile and expansive headlines on large displays without compromising consistency. In interfaces, highly legible sans serif faces coexist with more expressive display fonts used sparingly to signal brand personality.
Another notable trend is the blending of historical references with contemporary technology. Some typefaces include OpenType features that activate historical forms such as the long "s" or blackletter-inspired shapes so that designers can create period atmospheres while still benefiting from modern rendering, hinting, and multilingual character coverage. Other families embrace brutalist or "incorrect" aesthetics, deliberately exaggerating contrast or disrupting conventional proportions to create memorable, attention-grabbing headlines.
