If the mechanical typewriter standardized letterforms on paper, digital typography exploded the possibilities for letter design on screen and in print. Early computer systems offered only a limited set of bitmap fonts, but the introduction of scalable outline fonts such as Adobe's PostScript Type 1 and Apple's TrueType allowed letters to be rendered at any size with smooth curves. The OpenType format, co-developed by Adobe and Microsoft, further extended this model by adding advanced layout features and support for large character sets.
