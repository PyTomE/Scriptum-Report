OpenType fonts can store thousands of glyphs, including ligatures, small caps, stylistic alternates, and historical letterforms. Designers can use OpenType features to substitute glyphs contextually: for instance, replacing a pair of letters with a ligature that improves spacing or activating historical forms to evoke a particular period. This capability goes far beyond what was possible with a single, fixed set of metal type or a typewriter typebasket.
Digital typewriting also changed the economics of distribution. Instead of purchasing a physical machine with a single built-in typeface, designers and writers now license fonts separately. Online foundries and marketplaces offer thousands of type families, from workhorse text faces to experimental display designs. This abundance makes typographic choice a central part of visual communication in branding, user interfaces, and editorial design.
