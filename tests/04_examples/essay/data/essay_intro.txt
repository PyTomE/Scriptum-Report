It then examines the "state of the art" in letter design, focusing on OpenType technology, variable fonts, color fonts, and contemporary trends in typography. The journey from Remington typewriters to responsive web typography shows how a seemingly old-fashioned technology continues to shape how we read, write, and design text today.
