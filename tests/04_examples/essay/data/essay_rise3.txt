This mechanism increased reliability and reduced jams. It also allowed users to swap the typeball, effectively changing the typeface on a single machine. This flexibility foreshadowed the font menus of digital word processors: typists could choose between different styles, such as serif and sans serif designs, by replacing a physical component.
Electric typewriters also integrated with early computing systems. Hybrid machines such as IBM's MT/ST (Magnetic Tape/Selectric Typewriter) combined a typewriter keyboard and print mechanism with magnetic tape storage, allowing documents to be recorded, edited, and reprinted. These systems bridged the gap between purely mechanical typewriters and fully electronic word processors.
