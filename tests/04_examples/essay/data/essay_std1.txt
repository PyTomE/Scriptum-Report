In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, competing manufacturers refined typewriter design. New models added the shift key, allowing the same typebars to produce both uppercase and lowercase letters. Others introduced "visible writing" mechanisms so that typists could see the text as it was produced, improving speed and accuracy. By the early 1900s, typewriters had converged on a broadly familiar form: a keyboard, a carriage with a platen, a return lever, and a ribbon mechanism.
