Standardization in typewriter design reshaped business communication. Typewritten documents offered uniform appearance and high legibility, which was particularly valuable in rapidly expanding corporations. The typewriter also had deep social implications. It opened new professional opportunities for women as typists, stenographers, and secretaries. In many Western countries, the proportion of women in clerical jobs rose sharply between the 1870s and the early twentieth century. For many, learning to type represented a path to relatively better pay and working conditions than factory labor.
At the same time, typewriting influenced writing itself. Authors such as Mark Twain, who famously submitted one of the first typewritten manuscripts, discovered that the machine changed their relationship to the text. The consistent letterforms, lack of handwriting idiosyncrasies, and ease of editing by retyping a page encouraged more iterative drafting. The typewriter also contributed to the standardization of document formats: business letters, memos, and forms became more uniform as writers followed shared conventions for margins, line spacing, and punctuation.
