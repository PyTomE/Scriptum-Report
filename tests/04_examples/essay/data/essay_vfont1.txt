One of the most important developments in contemporary typography is the rise of variable fonts. Variable fonts are OpenType font files that can store continuous ranges of design variations such as weight, width, and slant within a single file. Instead of shipping separate fonts for Light, Regular, Bold, Condensed, and Expanded styles, a typedesigner can encode these as axes in one variable font. Applications and web browsers can then interpolate smoothly between styles.
