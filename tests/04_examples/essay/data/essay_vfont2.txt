Technically, variable fonts are based on the OpenType Font Variations mechanism, introduced into the OpenType specification in 2016. This technology allows software to select any instance along one or more axes of variation. For example, a designer might set body text at an intermediate weight and width that are not available as discrete fonts in a traditional family. On the web, variable fonts offer performance advantages because one file can replace many; in some experiments, consolidating dozens of styles into a single variable font has yielded substantial reductions in total font file size.
Variable fonts also open creative possibilities. Designers can animate typographic properties in response to user interaction letters that grow heavier on hover, or headlines that subtly expand as the viewport widens. They can encode custom axes for more experimental effects, such as the amount of serif, the roundness of terminals, or even the "mood" of a display typeface. In this way, variable fonts turn type design from a static set of snapshots into a parametric design space.
