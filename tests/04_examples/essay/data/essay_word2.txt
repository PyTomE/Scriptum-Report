As computers became standard office equipment, the role of the typewriter diminished. By the late twentieth century, most professional documents were created digitally. Yet the conceptual legacy of typewriting persisted. Computer keyboards largely adopted the typewriter's physical layout and QWERTY arrangement, preserving continuity in user skills. Even the language of computing reflects this heritage: we still speak of "typing" an email or "backspacing" to delete characters.
Today, typewriters occupy a niche as collectors' items, artistic tools, and symbols of a more tactile, deliberate approach to writing. Some authors and artists choose mechanical typewriters precisely because they lack the infinite undo and distraction-rich environment of digital devices. Meanwhile, the mainstream of text production has shifted to laptops, tablets, and phones, where virtual keyboards and predictive text further abstract the act of typewriting.
