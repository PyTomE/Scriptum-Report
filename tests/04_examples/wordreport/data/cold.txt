When a pudding gets frozen, the water inside its creamy mixture turns into ice crystals, which expand and disrupt its smooth structure. Ingredients like starch, eggs, or gelatin can separate slightly as the mixture solidifies, so the once-silky texture may become grainy or watery after thawing. Flavors generally remain, but the pudding can lose some richness because fats harden and then don't fully recombine when defrosted. In essence, freezing preserves the pudding but often at the cost of its original, delicate consistency.
