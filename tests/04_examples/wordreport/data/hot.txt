When a pudding gets too hot, the delicate balance of its thickening agents - like eggs, starch, or gelatin - can break down. Overheating causes the proteins in eggs to curdle or scramble, turning the mixture lumpy instead of silky. Starch-thickened puddings may loosen again as their bonds break, leading to a runny or separated texture. Sugars can caramelize at high temperatures, altering the flavor and darkening the color. In short, too much heat transforms a smooth, creamy pudding into something grainy, watery, or overcooked.
